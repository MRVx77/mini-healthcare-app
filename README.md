# Mini Healthcare Support Web App

## Overview

This is a simple healthcare support web application designed for NGOs.
It allows patients to submit healthcare-related requests and provides an
AI-based FAQ assistant to answer common questions automatically.

The project focuses on clarity, usability, and conceptual AI integration.

## Features

- Patient Support Request Form
- AI-powered FAQ Assistant (rule-based automation)
- Clean and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS

---

## AI / Automation Idea

The AI FAQ Assistant simulates an intelligent chatbot using keyword-based
matching to identify user intent and provide relevant responses.

This helps NGOs:

- Reduce repetitive questions
- Respond faster to common healthcare queries
- Improve overall efficiency

---

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js (Vite)
- Language: JavaScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- AI Logic: Rule-based FAQ automation (concept simulation)

---

## NGO Use Case

NGOs often receive repeated healthcare-related questions.
This application helps by:

- Digitally collecting patient support requests
- Automatically answering common questions
- Allowing volunteers to focus on urgent cases

---

### Hybrid AI FAQ System

The FAQ assistant uses a hybrid approach:

- Rule-based automation for common questions
- Real AI (OpenAI) as a fallback for complex or unknown queries

This ensures:

- Fast responses
- Low operational cost
- Graceful degradation if AI services are unavailable

## Future Improvements

- Integrate real AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI)
- Add admin dashboard for NGOs
- Store form submissions in a database
- Add multilingual support
